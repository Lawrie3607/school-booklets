Place your application icons here before building the desktop app.

Required:
- app-icon.png   (recommended 512x512 PNG for cross-platform packaging)

Optional (for nicer platform-specific icons):
- win/icon.ico   (Windows .ico file)
- mac/icon.icns  (macOS .icns file)

If you don't have icons now, add a `app-icon.png` file later in `public/` and re-run the build.
